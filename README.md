===============   Important places to code in .main   ===============
<br />

/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */ <br />
//Here you declare global variables <br />
/* USER CODE END PV */ <br />
<br />
<br />
/* USER CODE BEGIN PFP */ <br />
Functions Declaration (helps to remove warnings of program) <br />
e.g. : <br />
void function(); <br />
/* USER CODE END PFP */ <br />
<br />
<br />
/* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */ <br />
while (1) <br />
{ <br />
//Here comes the code thatÂ´s gonna work in loop <br />

 /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */ <br />
 
 //If you are using STM32 as a HID(Human Interface Device) you should put your code that is going to repeat inside this tag <br />
 
  /* USER CODE END 3 */ <br />

<br />
 /* USER CODE END WHILE */ <br />
 <br />
<br />
/* USER CODE BEGIN 4 */ <br />
Here you put the functions that you are going to use or call <br />
e.g. : <br />
void function() { <br />
//CODE <br />
} <br />
<br />
/* USER CODE END 4 */ <br />
